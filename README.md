# Polynomial/Rational CFU

## Overview

This application allows users to test their understanding of the relationship between a polynomial equation or a rational equation and its corresponding graph.

## Usage

Users will be given a polynomial or rational equation (randomly-generated according to user settings), and they will click on areas on a 2D grid to plot zeroes, asymptotes, and the locations of functions.

After users plotting their graph, they can verify whether they graphed the equation correctly.

# Equation Generation Options

Users can choose between the two equation types:
 * Polynomail equations
 * Rational equations

For rational equations, users can choose whether the equation has the following:
 * vertical asymptotes
 * horizontal asymptotes
 * oblique asymptotes
 * holes
